# HousingPrediction
This project uses housing and neighborhood data to predict housing prices.


For DataAcquistion Branch
First step was to concat all 7 csvs to get full_dataset.csv the code used was part of DataAcquistion.ipynb
Second step was to retain only apartments that appear times and are the exact same except for price and date in Dataset_to merge.csv and Remove_Duplicates_Fixed.ipynb
Third step was cleaning to get Dataset_to_clean and Merge.ipynb
Fourth was to get the final dataset: Cleaned_Apartments using Clean.ipynb
The output Cleaned_Apartments is ready to be used in the predicting model. 

Note: Check the datatype of sorted_prices after reading the csvs
